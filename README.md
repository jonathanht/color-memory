## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
 https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One challenge that I faced was implementing the decreasing time for sound cues as the player progressed through the game. In order to properly address this feature I had to keep the value of progress in mind. I eventually discovered an optimal timing interval that was not too difficult to play with but not too easy through play-testing the game myself a couple of times. I also had trouble with finding colors I wanted to use for my CSS code, and to overcome that I refered to w3school's CSS reference page, which helped me a lot.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing this submission I would say that it helped garnered my interest for front-end web development. How does CSS and HTML translate into the fully developed user interfaces that webdevs create for their websites?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
